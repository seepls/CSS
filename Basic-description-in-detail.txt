Scripted CSS enables a variety of interesting visual effects :
- animated transitions etc

-- there are various variables in visual display of an html doc
 CSS standard enumerates these variables and call them style properties 

to define the visual appearance of HTML elements we specify value of CSS properties

name : value ;

- style 
- stylesheet: associates sets of style properties with set of html elements that are described using selectors .
A selector selects one or more elements of a document based on ID , class or tag name .

basic element of CSS stylesheet is a style rule ::::
{selector : set of CSS properties and their values }
any number of style rules 

stylesheet -> HTML doc  : enclose in <style> </style>

within head of a document 

if a CSS file to be used more than one page on a website : store it in its own file ( without any enclosing HTML tags)
then it can be included in the HTML page .
to include a stylesheet in an HTML page use a <link> in the <head> of a document 


3 sources :
- Styles from the style attribute 
- styles from stylesheets
- browsers default styles

visual is the combination from all the three sources 

To display any document element the web browser must combine the style attribute of that element with styles from all the matched slectors in the document stylesheets 

the result of this computation is the actual set of style properties and values are the used to display the element .
This set of values is known as the computed style of the element
